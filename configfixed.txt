//INSTRUCTIONS:
//Separate key = value pairs with spaces!
//Don't use spaces for anything else (use _ instead)
//
//Positions/Velocities are RELATIVE
//i.e.
//positions of planets are relative to the to the parent solarsystem
//positions of solarsystems are relative to the parent galaxy
//etc.
//This makes it very easy to create a lot of systems
